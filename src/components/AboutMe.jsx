                My expertise lies in crafting
                dynamic, engaging interfaces through writing clean and optimized
                code and utilizing cutting-edge development tools and
                techniques. Being a full-stack allows me to not only develop client-facing apps and websites but also develop it with cutting edge backend support.

I specialize in building robust backends that do all the heavy lifting for your app or website. I love designing systems that are light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective.
                applications.
